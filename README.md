# Unsupervised nlp K-means ocr
Unsupervised text classification (OCR data) using k-means with 100% accuracy. 

Objective:
Each year, the accounting management service is scaning thousands of invoices and contracts. All these pdf scans are stored in a Database, and manually flaged. The accounting service wants to automate the process.
Given a bunch of documents without label are you able to separate invoices from contracts?
As a Data Scientist you offer to implement a machine learning solution. Nonetheless, accounting services bring to your attention:
Formats are constantly evolving therefore, you cannot use past documents to design your solution
They will send you TEXT data after passing pdf into an OCR (noise may happen)
